# README

Welcome, and thanks for checking out shipspec. This is a Saas app for auto transporters to inspect, take photos of, and track their shipments. 

as of 10/26/17 it is in MVP dev stage, so watch for daily updates. 

* Rails 5.1.4
* Ruby version ruby 2.3.3-p222

set up is simple, clone repo, cd-in, rake db:migrate, boot server - rails s, and check it out on localhost:3000 or you can simply see the working example here: https://shipspec.herokuapp.com/

feel free to check out my rough googledocs schema drawing of the high level data model here: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1VoGvUegfiDBAps12K3Ajz5h_iCXvrpdoVedh29huQ6A/edit?usp=sharing
